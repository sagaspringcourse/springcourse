== Exercise 01-ps-start-practice
And now that you know what Spring can help you with,
you are invited to have a taste of how things are done without it.

Take a look at the `01-ps-start-practice project`. In the `SimpleOperationsService` class there is
a method named `createResponse` that needs an implementation.

The steps to create a `Response` instance are:

. retrieve the sitter User instance using userRepo
. retrieve the Request instance using requestRepo
. instantiate a Response instance
. populate the Response instance:
.. set the response status to `ResponseStatus.PROPOSED`
.. set the user to the sitter instance
.. set details with a sample text
.. add the response to the request object
.. save the response object using the verb|responseRepo|
