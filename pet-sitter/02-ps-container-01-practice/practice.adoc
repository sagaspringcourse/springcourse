== Exercise 02-ps-container-01-practice

!  Since this is the end of an important section, there is a task for you.

In project 02-ps-container-01-practice there is a configuration file that has gotten a little too big:

02-ps-container-01-practice/src/main/resources/spring/others/sample-config-01.xml.

Split this file into one or more configuration files, and modify the test class
com.ps.beans.others.MtBeanTest to use those files to load the context.
The test must complete successfully in order to validate your configuration.

A solution is provided for you in the 02-ps-container-01-solution project.
You can compare your result with this and draw conclusions.
As a bonus, try using wildcards.
